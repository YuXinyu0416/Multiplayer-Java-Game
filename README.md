# COMP1110/1140/6710 Semester 2 2024 Assignment 2

_Note_: The assignment is still under development. This is just a
placeholder. We will announce when the assignment is ready, via the
course forum and in lectures. At that time, please do an upstream
pull.

## Purpose

In this assignment you will implement a game. It will be a desktop version
of a pen-and-paper game. A GUI (graphical user interface) will be provided,
that you can use, but you have to build the "backend" of the program, that
implements the game logic, from scratch. This means you will create a
larger piece of code, consisting of several classes that work together
and that integrate with a given framework (the GUI).

You are not required to use the predefined GUI as it is: if you want your
game to look different, you can modify it, or even replace it completely.
As long as your game follows the rules and is easy to play, it is ok.

## Group work and academic integrity

For this assignment you are allowed to work in groups of up to at most
three. Groups **must be declared**, using the group sign-up on the course
wattle site.

**Collaboration between groups is not allowed**.

This does not mean you discuss the assignment with, or ask questions of,
the teaching staff and others in the class.
However, *you must never misrepresent the work of others as your own*.
If you have used ideas from anyone or anywhere, or used any code that is
not entirely your own creation, you must make this absolutely clear.
At each stage of the assignment you will be asked to submit a statement
of originality, either as a group or as individuals.
This statement is the place where  you must to declare which ideas or code
contained in your submission were sourced from anyone or anywhere else.

Please read the ANU's
[official position](http://academichonesty.anu.edu.au/) on academic honesty.
If you have any questions, please ask a lecturer, tutor, or make a post
on the Ed forum.

Carefully review the statements of originality in the [admin](admin)
folder which you must complete at each stage. Edit the relevant
statement and update it as you complete each stage of the assignment,
ensuring that when you complete each stage, a truthful statement is
committed and pushed to your repo.


## Assignment deliverables

The assignment is worth 35% of your total assessment, and it will be marked
out of 35. The assignment consists of several deliverables:

*   D2B: Initial design. Due in your week 5 lab.
*   D2C: First stage implementation. Due in the mid-semester teaching
	break (precise date TBA).
*   D2D: Test plan and unit test. Due in your week 8 lab.
*   D2E: Integration test. Due in your week 9 lab.
*   D2F: Final implementation. Due in semester week 11.
*   D2G: Presentation. Due in your week 12 lab.

For some deliverables you will get a _project_ mark, which is based on
the project as a whole and is shared equally by all members of the
group if the project is done by a group; for other deliverables each
student will be _individually_ marked (regardless of whether they are
in a group or not).

## Project repository structure

Your work will be marked by accessing your git rpo, so it is essential
that you carefully follow instructions for setting up and maintaining
your group repository. At each deadline you will be marked according to
whatever is pushed to your repository at the time of the deadline.
You will also be assessed on how effectively you use git as a development
tool.
